After another successful day working with Astro it's time to get my drink on with a glass of Guinness!

## Here are some fascinating facts about Guinness:

- **Origins**: Guinness was founded in 1759 in Dublin, Ireland, by Arthur Guinness. He signed a 9,000-year lease for the St. James's Gate Brewery at just £45 per year.
- **Ingredients**: It’s made with just four ingredients—malted barley, hops, brewer’s yeast, and water.
- **Perfect Pour**: Pouring a pint of Guinness is an art! It takes exactly 119.5 seconds to pour it perfectly, involving a two-step process.
- **Global Reach**: Guinness is brewed in over 150 countries, including Nigeria and Indonesia, and more than 10 million glasses are sold daily worldwide.
- **Guinness Book of World Records**: This famous record book was originally created in 1954 to settle pub arguments.
- **Calories**: A pint of Guinness has only 210 calories—less than a glass of orange juice or milk.

What do you think? Fancy a pint of "the black stuff"? 🍺
